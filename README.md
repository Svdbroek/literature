# literature
Lists of interesting literature, with notes.


The goal of this repo is to index literature for webdevelopment.
The repo will be mostly seperated into things I want to (re)read, and things I have already read.
I will try to add notes to read literature for indexing, reviewing and recapitulating of the texts. 



## Markdown guides
* https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ 
  - probably the only one I will need, more of a reference than a phylosophy. still very usefull
 
 
 
## Redux 
* https://leanpub.com/thinking-in-Redux 
  - main design phylosophy at my job. deserves a reread, will come with notes.
  
* https://gist.github.com/gaearon/ffd88b0e4f00b22c3159
  - the basics of redux in 99 lines. great for understanding how redux works, needs a reread
  
* https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/normalizing-state-shape
  - on the shape of reduxstate, always keep in mind! use as reference!

## Rest API's
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/411462/restful-way-to-create-multiple-items-in-one-request
  - basepoint for a grand search on restful api's. one answer stood out to me:
    > "Resources don't need to map to your database or app models". what a resource means in this context is not yet clear to me. will require additional reading. Listed below:
    
* [From: readthedocs.io](https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources.html#:~:text=The%20fundamental%20concept%20in%20any,methods%20that%20operate%20on%20it.&text=Each%20collection%20is%20homogeneous%20so,type%20of%20resource%2C%20and%20unordered.) On resources in a rest API
  - a little more basic than I had hoped, still gave me some insight on what an API really is. Worth reading the complete document, is a short read. 
  - still looking for a more definitive answer on what is a resource

* https://www.infoq.com/presentations/effective-api-design/
  - presentation on API-design phylosophy, more focussed on public APIs. Still offered valuable insight into designing code, not only for APIs but any application. 
  -sparked some interest in learning to write documentation, readme's
 

## JS
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/400212/how-do-i-copy-to-the-clipboard-in-javascript
  - how to make a text copy button. usefull, us
 
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/342378/cross-domain-login-how-to-log-a-user-in-automatically-when-transferred-from-on
  - crossdomain login, interesting theory on shared tokens, use as a refference
  

## PHP
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54181162/php-structuring-a-slim3-web-application-using-mvc-and-understanding-the-role-o
  - needs reading
  
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30365346/what-is-the-spaceship-operator-in-php-7
  - simple question, could use some rereading, right now php is a mystery to me
  
 
## MySQL
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41861914/php-sql-multiple-fuzzy-keyword-search-based-on-likeness-advanced-sql-search
  - needs reading

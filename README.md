# literature
Lists of interesting literature, with notes.


The goal of this repo is to index literature for webdevelopment.
The repo will be mostly seperated into things I want to (re)read, and things I have already read.
I will try to add notes to read literature for indexing, reviewing and recapitulating of the texts.
